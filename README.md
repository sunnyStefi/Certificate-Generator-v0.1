## Course Certificate Generator - Dynamic NFT - ERC1155

Fullstack application that simulates a real world certificate-issuer institution.

**Process and Schemas**

An _User_ can buy a Place NFT token, which will enable him to become an _Enrolled Student_ for that particular Course. An examination will take place in real life and one listed Evaluator will register the mark in a specific date.
After that moment, the admin will either:

1. convert the Places to Certificates, which will remain inside the Promoted Student's accounts
2. burn unsold or failed Places
